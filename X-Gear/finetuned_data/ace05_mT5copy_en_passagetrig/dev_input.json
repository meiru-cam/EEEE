I do n't know if this is so , and I really think it 's sort of irrelevant .",
    "It 's irrelevant because the REAL question is whether an active board member can , while on the board , arrange to be given money by the USCF .",
    "Of course it 's in the bylaws that an active board member can not be given money by the USCF while on the board .",
    "It ought to be pretty obvious that it would be entirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be money after leaving the board .",
    "It ought to be pretty obvious that it would be entirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be money after leaving the board .",

    "If the board can not vote to give themselves present money , they can not vote to give themselves future money either .",
    "Furthermore , it does n't matter whether this arrangement is embodied in an EB vote or not , or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in a formal EB meeting or not .",
    "A board member , while on the board , is supposed to be representing the interests of the USCF , not feathering his / her nest , in the present or in the future .",
    "If a board member makes such arrangements , it is clearly an ethics violation , clearly a violation of the bylaws , possibly endangers our tax - exempt status , and is possibly a violation of law as well .",
    "The purpose of having a \" time limit \" would be as a mechanism to ensure compliance with the above principles ; that is , you would have a time limit because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to violate the above prohibition ; it would give the voters time to elect a new EB that would consider the issues objectively .",
    "Of course , it is possible that someone could leave the board -without- ever having discussed being compensated by the board in the future , and that then the remaining members could , for good reason , hire that person .",

    "Of course , it is possible that someone could leave the board -without- ever having discussed being compensated by the board in the future , and that then the remaining members could , for good reason , hire that person .",
    "But this is neither here nor there , because the fact that Randy Bauer is already talking about Beatriz Marinello as the USCF 's new \" move coordinator \" , whatever that involves , and whether or not it means that she would be the de facto interim ED , means that at some level and in some form these discussions HAVE already taken place , while Marinello is serving as President .",
    "I mean , it 's conceivable that the other six have all gotten together in Marinello 's absence and drafted her , but it also seems pretty clear that she has agreed to do it , and , if all the rumors are true and she steps down , it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities . So the ' time limit ' issue does n't even come up .",

    "- asking the Interim ED to hire some other consultant with experience in office relocation to manage the job ( there are such people )",
    "One very bad argument that was made by Kevin Bachler , which to be fair was surrounded by arguably better ones , was that since this board was elected , we should let them do as they please .",
    "Which is to say that there might as well not be bylaws , ethics standards , laws , etc . , since an elected board is not bound by any of them .",
    "Another argument , which is better but still disturbing , is that , yes , this is an ethics violation , and maybe worse , but it would only hurt the USCF to talk about it , and that only troublemakers like Sam Sloan , Larry Parr , and , I suppose , me , would talk about it , since doing so will obstruct the federation 's plans , cause us to pay legal expenses , run the risk of our being stuck without any office space at all , cause people not to loan us money , and so forth .",
